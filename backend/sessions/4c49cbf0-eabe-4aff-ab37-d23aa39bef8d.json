      "transcript": "So yeah, there was a time when I had to learn new technologies and frameworks. So I used the chat GPT to learn and other syntax and everything. So it really helped me a lot using AI nowadays. It acts as a coding buddy for you and it makes the task easier and I believe in learning while building. So I build it, build it for the project, will use the new technology and framework for the project while learning it. So yes.",

To improve, use the STAR method: describe a specific Situation (the project), the Task (the technology/framework), the Actions you took (specific steps beyond just 'syntax and everything,' including how you utilized AI and other resources), and the Result or outcome. Naming the specific technology/framework and discussing any challenges encountered would also significantly strengthen your response.",

      "transcript": "So the main technical challenge was to get a large data set for the entry system and I used the sample one because we didn't get the large one.",

      "feedback": "Your answer was very brief and only partially addressed the question. While identifying data acquisition as a challenge is valid, you missed describing the design and implementation process entirely. To improve, elaborate on the specific steps you took to overcome the challenge, instead of just stating a limitation, and discuss other technical challenges faced during the project. Providing more detail about technologies used and your problem-solving approach would significantly strengthen your response.",
