      "transcript": "So yes, there was a time when I had to manage multiple design projects with competing deadlines. Like one was at 11 and another one was at 12. So what I did was, I prioritized my task. I planned my day accordingly and worked on what was more important. And for example, 11 o'clock deadline was more closer, so I worked on that and then gave my extra effort for the 12 o'clock one. So yeah, that's how I did it.",

      "feedback": "Your answer acknowledges the prompt directly but lacks specific details to be impactful. To improve, describe the *types* and *complexity* of the design projects involved. Explain your prioritization criteria beyond just the nearest deadline, perhaps mentioning impact or dependencies. Most importantly, detail the specific actions you took for *each* project and the positive outcome of your management, ideally using the STAR method. This will provide a much clearer and more compelling picture of your capabilities.",
